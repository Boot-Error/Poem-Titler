As the daylight dimmed
And the darkness encompassed everything
Words unsaid and tasks unfinished
Slowly the world was lulled into a dreamland
Two restless souls wide awake
Discovering and rediscovering
The enchantments and vices of nightfall
Deep in an ocean of fireflies and wild lilies
A wise serendipity now replenished their hearts
